    "Company stock prices are very volatile and always changing. It is very difficult to determine how a stock will perform in the future. Evaluating the company and guessing its future performance requires a great deal of research into the company and analysis of its historical data. Gathering and examining the data for a company can be very difficult and require a lot of time."

They also monitor many different aspects of a company and their stock price, and are constantly updating and recording this data. The goal of this project is to use visualization and technical analysis on historical data to determine a stocks value and risk, and then predict its future performance. \n",

    "If successful, this would be a great way to process tons of data on a company and extract data that would otherwise be impossible to generate ourselves. This could assist you in making trading decisions, taking into account the risk, value, and prediction of a stock. No matter how successful this is though, this won't be able to account for many external factors that can affect a stock's price. It would be impossible to account for external impacts later in the future. If this were to be very accurate, it could change how trading occurs. If every trading decision being made were based on lots of data analysis and computer generated predictions, that would take away the human element of trading. These decisions would be purely logical and wouldn't have any emotion component as trading does now. "
